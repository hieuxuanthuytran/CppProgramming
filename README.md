# Project: Jam of the Month
   1. Prompt the user for which package they have, from the following:
   * Package A:
        - $8/month
        * Includes 2 jams per month
        * Each additional jam on top of the 2 is $5 each.
   * Package B:
        * $12/month
        * Includes 4 jams per month
        * Each additional jam on top of the 4 is $4 each.
   * Package C: 
        * $15/month
        * Includes 6 jams per month
        * Each additional jam on top of the 6 is $3 each.
   2. Prompt the user for how many jams they purchased this month, in total.
   3. The program will then take the number of jams purchased and then tell the user their total cost.
   * This will depend on what package they own.
   * If they stayed at or under the number of jams included in their monthly package, they only owe the monthly fee.
   * If they went over, then you charde them the monthly fee plus the charge for each additional jam at their package's rate.
