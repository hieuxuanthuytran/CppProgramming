# Project: Jam of the Month
   1. Prompt the user for which package they have, from the following:
   * Package A:
        * $8/month
        * Includes 2 jams per month
        * Each additional jam on top of the 2 is $5 each.
   * Package B:
        * $12/month
        * Includes 4 jams per month
        * Each additional jam on top of the 4 is $4 each.
   * Package C: 
        * $15/month
        * Includes 6 jams per month
        * Each additional jam on top of the 6 is $3 each.
   2. Prompt the user for how many jams they purchased this month, in total.
   3. The program will then take the number of jams purchased and then tell the user their total cost.
       * This will depend on what package they own.
       * If they stayed at or under the number of jams included in their monthly package, they only owe the monthly fee.
       * If they went over, then you charde them the monthly fee plus the charge for each additional jam at their package's rate.
# Project: OddsAndEvens
     Loop through integers 0 to 50 (inclusive)
     Print out whether each integer is odd or even, such as:
     - "_______ is odd" or "________ is even"
# Project: GuessTheNumber
     The computer will randomly select an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
     * The user will try and guess the computer's number
     * Also count the number of guesses
     Four possibilities:
     * If the user guesses correctly, print "Congratulations! You guessed the number in <#guesses>! Thanks for playing" and program exits
     * If the user selects a number too low, print out "Your guess is too low!"
     * If the user selects a number too high, print out "Your guess is too high!"
     * If the user selects a number lower than 1 or higher than 100, tell the user it was a wasted guess and to pick between 1 and 100.
